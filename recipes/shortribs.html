    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Recently the internet went wild for a delicious Mississippi pot roast wherein beef is braised in a slow cooker with butter, 
        pepperoncini, and packets of powdered au jus gravy and ranch dressing. Guessing that the MSG from the latter two ingredients 
        explained all the rage, I decided to mimic the flavors using from-scratch seasonings and boneless short ribs.
         It came out really well, especially when served over mashed potatoes with a garnish of parsley.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ pounds boneless beef short ribs </li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sliced fresh mushrooms </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Season short ribs with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Heat oil in a pan over high heat. 
        Add short ribs and sear until well browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer beef to a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-high and add onion and mushrooms to the pan. Season with salt.
         Saute until mushrooms are golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine kosher salt, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, dill, rosemary, thyme, and 
        Parmesan cheese in a small bowl. Sprinkle seasoning mixture evenly over the beef.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle flour over the onion and mushrooms. Stir to coat and cook for 2 minutes. Pour in chicken broth, 
            soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Stir and bring to a boil; remove from heat. 
            Pour mixture over the beef and cover with pepperoncini. Place butter on top. Cover baking dish with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meat is fork-tender and falls apart easily, about 2 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Spoon sauce from the bottom of the pan onto the beef to serve. Skim off excess fat as desired.</li>
    </ol>
